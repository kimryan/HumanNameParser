    # optional configuration arguments
    my %args =
    (
        auto_clean      => 1,
        force_case      => 1,
        lc_prefix       => 1,
        initials        => 3,
        allow_reversed  => 1,
        joint_names     => 0,
        extended_titles => 0
    );

    my $name =  Lingua::EN::NameParse->new(%args);

    $error = $name->parse("MR AC DE SILVA");

    %name_comps = $name->components;
    $surname = $name_comps{surname_1}; # De Silva

    $correct_casing = $name->case_all; # Mr AC de Silva

    $correct_casing = $name->case_all_reversed ; # de Silva, AC

    $good_name = &clean("Bad Na9me   "); # "Bad Name"
 
    $salutation = $name->salutation(salutation => 'Dear',sal_default => 'Friend')); # Dear Mr de Silva

    %my_properties = $name->properties;
    $number_surnames = $my_properties{number}; # 1
    $bad_input = $my_properties{non_matching};

    $name->report; # create a report listing all information about the parsed name

    $lc_prefix = 0;
    $correct_case = &case_surname("DE SILVA-MACNAY",$lc_prefix); # De Silva-MacNay


DESCRIPTION

This module takes as input a person or persons name in
free format text such as,

    Mr AB & M/s CD MacNay-Smith
    MR J.L. D'ANGELO
    Estate Of The Late Lieutenant Colonel AB Van Der Heiden

and attempts to parse it. If successful, the name is broken
down into components and useful functions can be performed like :

- converting upper or lower case values to name case (Mr AB MacNay   )
- creating a personalised greeting or salutation     (Dear Mr MacNay )
- extracting the names individual components         (Mr,AB,MacNay   )
- determining the type of format the name is in      (Mr_A_Smith     )

If the name cannot be parsed you have the option of cleaning the name
of bad characters, or extracting any portion that was parsed and the
portion that failed.

This module can be used for analysing and improving the quality of
lists of names.
