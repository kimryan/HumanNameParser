1.34 1 Jun 2016
    Added military title Pvt (for Private in the USA) RT bug #113972

1.33 22 Apr 2015
    Removed 'Mr_J_Adam_Smith' name type.  Names that were most likely double surnames were being incorrectly parsed
        For example 'Mr A Smythe Taylor' was getting middle name of 'Smythe'. Should be picked up as error.
        Surname should be 'Smythe-Taylor'
    
    Fold all text to upper case prior to parsing, regexp matching is faster if case insensitive
        Note that this means all components are now NameCased by default.
        The case_components method has been removed as the 'components' method achieves the same outcome
        The force_case option has been removed
    
    non_matching text moved from properties to components
    
    Use extended regexp (/x) in grammar for better readability
    Simplified grammar and removed duplicate definitions
    Removed all full stops before parsing as this simplifies grammar, so: Mr. A.B. Smith => Mr AB Smith
    Added more valid prefixes
    'report' method now tests all functions
    removed indirect object notation for 'new' method
    added error and warning description attributes to name object

   Changed the parse method to match the documentation. It was returning a name

   caused no problem if used as documented, the error value was still assigned
   correctly, and the name object assigned to nothing. Thanks to Chris Prather.
